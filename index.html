            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions.</h1>
            <h3>Do I need to have gone to a hackathon to be a director?</h3>
            <p>No, our directors range from people that have founded hackathons in the past to people that have never been to one their life. We value passion about technology and dedication to the team very heavily.</p>
            <h3>What if I just want to hack or volunteer at the hackathon?</h3>
            <p>Currently we are recruiting for new directors but when the actual event draws closer we will reach out again for applications to hack or volunteer at the event.</p>
            <h3>Can I do more than one thing? / What if I donâ€™t know what I want to do?</h3>
            <p>Look into all different areas and express your interest in whichever areas on the application form. Do not worry that you're interested will change once you join the team, we are flexible with what you work on. But we suggest you are true to your interests as we strongly believe that real interest will stand out more than a fake one.</p>
            <h3>What is the time commitment for being a director?</h3>
            <p>The time commitment ramps as the hackathon becomes closer and you should be ready to commit a significant amount of time. However, do not let the fear of a large time commitment what is stopping you from applying, you will gradually adjust to the flow of the team and will be manageable.</p>
            <h3>How to stand out on the application?</h3>
            <p>If possible, make it out to one of our infosessions and try to talk to our directors. It becomes a lot easier to make a decision when we have a face to pair with the online application.</p>
